# RuneCraft
Summoners War rune crafting calculator. Included feature to balance crafts based on user input.
The Java version was just where I developed the original source code and worked on the logic that made the mathematics work. It is functional if you want to recompile
the code yourself, however:
The C# version is the complete GUI version. It uses the same logic to perform the mathematics, but this time it comes bundled in a nifty package with ease of usability.
The user-friendly C# version is ready to launch, and uses Windows Forms to come to life, right on your desktop!

Features of the calculator include:
- Ability to determine how many of a single rune you can craft based on the amount of materials you have.
- Ability to tell you how many materials you need to craft your desired number of runes.
- Ability to optimize your rune crafting experience to get the most runes out of the materials you have.
- Provided approximation of how many legendary 6* runes you should see, based on the crafting rate data available on SWARFARM.
- Provided amount of blue mana stones it will cost to craft all your runes. Be sure to stock up!

I will be taking user feedback and working out bugs as they become apparent. Please email bug discoveries and details surrounding the bug to eternaldark66@gmail.com.
I will have an updated list of known and discovered bugs at the bottom of this README, so please check the list before emailing!

Known and discovered bugs and issues:
- Balance feature incorrectly includes an excluded value when used for 2 rune types.
- Calculate supplies feature stopped working. Does nothing.
- Balance help is too interefering. Began update to shift help to a help button that the user can choose to use, instead of forced.
- Window not resizing was a poor choice, some users want that control over window size. Bagan update to allow user control of window size.
- I'm sure more will come.
