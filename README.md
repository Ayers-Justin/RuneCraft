# RuneCraft
Summoners War rune crafting calculator. Included feature to balance crafts based on user input.
The Java version was just where I developed the original source code and worked on the logic that made the mathematics work. It is functional if you want to recompile
the code yourself, however:
The C# version is the complete GUI version. It uses the same logic to perform the mathematics, but this time it comes bundled in a nifty package with ease of usability.
The user-friendly C# version is ready to launch, and uses Windows Forms to come to life, right on your desktop!

Features of the calculator include:
a) Ability to determine how many of a single rune you can craft based on the amount of materials you have.
b) Ability to tell you how many materials you need to craft your desired number of runes.
c) Ability to optimize your rune crafting experience to get the most runes out of the materials you have.
d) Provided approximation of how many legendary 6* runes you should see, based on the crafting rate data available on SWARFARM.
e) Provided amount of blue mana stones it will cost to craft all your runes. Be sure to stock up!

I will be taking user feedback and working out bugs as they become apparent. Please email bug discoveries and details surrounding the bug to eternaldark66@gmail.com.
